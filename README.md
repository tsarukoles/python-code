Topics Covered in the Challenges
  These challenges cover a wide range of foundational Python programming concepts and problem-solving techniques. Here’s a breakdown of the topics explored:
________________________________________
String Manipulation:
  •	Lesson 3:
    o	Task 301 involves reversing a string to display the text backward.
    o	Task 303 and Task 304 focus on counting occurrences of a substring within a string, including case-insensitive searching.
    o	Task 305 and Task 313 demonstrate how to replace substrings or specific words within a given string.
  These tasks emphasize core string operations, such as reversing, searching, and replacing text, which are essential in text processing and data manipulation tasks.
________________________________________
Conditional Statements:
  •	Lesson 2:
    o	Task 217 calculates the power of a number based on user input.
    o	Task 211 checks whether a number is positive, negative, or zero, using if-elif-else conditions.
    o	Task 215 identifies the current season based on the inputted month.
  •	Lesson 4:
    o	Task 416 and Task 418 apply conditional logic to print a filled or hollow square of stars, allowing users to choose between the two options.
  Conditional statements are central in determining the flow of control in a program, allowing the tasks to behave differently based on specific input values.
________________________________________
Loops:
  •	Lesson 4:
    o	Task 401, Task 402, and Task 403 involve iterating over a range of numbers and skipping certain values based on conditions (like skipping even or odd numbers).
    o	Task 405 and Task 406 use for loops to count multiples of 5 and 7 in a given range and print multiplication tables.
  •	Lesson 3:
    o	Task 309 and Task 319 demonstrate how to reverse strings and perform arithmetic operations on characters or numbers within a string using loops.
  Loops are key in many programming tasks, especially those involving iterations over sequences, lists, or ranges. These tasks illustrate both simple and nested loops in various contexts.
________________________________________
Functions:
  •	Lesson 2:
    o	Task 203 involves creating a function that returns the maximum, minimum, and average of three numbers.
    o	Task 218 calculates the total sales and salary for managers based on sales percentages.
  •	Lesson 5:
    o	Test 507 creates a function to check if a number is "lucky," based on the sum of its digits.
    o	Test 506 checks if a number is prime by defining a function that performs divisibility checks.
  Functions allow tasks to be modular and reusable, making the code easier to manage and reducing redundancy. These tasks focus on encapsulating logic inside functions for better structure and flexibility.
________________________________________
Mathematics and Number Theory:
  •	Lesson 2:
    o	Task 204 performs conversions between different units (meters to miles, etc.).
    o	Task 216 is the FizzBuzz challenge, where numbers divisible by 3 or 5 are replaced with specific words.
  •	Lesson 5:
    o	Test 506 checks for prime numbers, which is a classic number theory problem.
    o	Test 512 counts digits in a number, while Test 513 reverses a number and checks if it’s a palindrome.
  These tasks focus on mathematical algorithms and properties, showcasing how Python can be used to solve basic number theory problems.
________________________________________
Input and Output:
  •	Lesson 4:
    o	Task 409 allows the user to choose between converting currency from USD to UAH or UAH to USD.
    o	Task 411 is an interactive random number guessing game where the user tries to guess the correct number.
  Many tasks rely on input() to dynamically gather information from users and print() to display results, allowing interaction and feedback loops within the program.
________________________________________
Basic Algorithm Design:
  •	Lesson 2:
    o	Task 213 implements a lucky number checker by summing digits and comparing two halves of the number.
    o	Task 214 rearranges digits in a number to create a new format.
  •	Lesson 5:
    o	Test 508 prints even numbers between two inputs using a simple algorithm based on divisibility by 2.
  These tasks emphasize problem decomposition, where each challenge breaks a problem into smaller steps to be solved systematically.
________________________________________
Pattern Printing:
  •	Lesson 4:
    o	Task 416, Task 417, and Task 418 generate patterns such as filled or empty squares and rectangles using nested loops.
    o	Task 423 and Task 424 print more complex shapes like diamonds and checkerboard patterns.
  These challenges illustrate how loops can be used to create geometric patterns and shapes, a common exercise in early programming tasks.
________________________________________
Error Checking and Logic:
  •	Lesson 5:
    o	Test 506 checks if a number is prime by performing multiple divisibility checks, handling special cases like 2 and negative numbers.
    o	Test 507 checks for lucky numbers by breaking them down into individual digits and performing calculations.
  These tasks focus on implementing the correct logic and handling different cases, showcasing the importance of error checking and validation in programming.
